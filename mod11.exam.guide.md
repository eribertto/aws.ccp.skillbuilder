Exam domains

The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam includes four domains:

1. Cloud Concepts

2. Security and Compliance

3. Technology

4. Billing and Pricing

The areas covered describe each domain in the Exam Guide for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification. For a description of each domain, review the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner website. You are encouraged to read the information in the Exam Guide as part of your preparation for the exam.

Each domain in the exam is weighted. The weight represents the percentage of questions in the exam that correspond to that particular domain. These are approximations, so the questions on your exam may not match these percentages exactly. The exam does not indicate the domain associated with a question. In fact, some questions can potentially fall under multiple domains.
