The Well-Architected Framework is based on five pillars: 

Operational excellence
Security
Reliability
Performance efficiency
Cost optimization

Operational excellence is the ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures.  

Design principles for operational excellence in the cloud include performing operations as code, annotating documentation, anticipating failure, and frequently making small, reversible changes.

The Security pillar is the ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies. 

When considering the security of your architecture, apply these best practices:

Automate security best practices when possible.
Apply security at all layers.
Protect data in transit and at rest.

Reliability is the ability of a system to do the following:

Recover from infrastructure or service disruptions
Dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand
Mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues
Reliability includes testing recovery procedures, scaling horizontally to increase aggregate system availability, and automatically recovering from failure.

Performance efficiency is the ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve. 

Evaluating the performance efficiency of your architecture includes experimenting more often, using serverless architectures, and designing systems to be able to go global in minutes.

Cost optimization is the ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point. 

Cost optimization includes adopting a consumption model, analyzing and attributing expenditure, and using managed services to reduce the cost of ownership.
