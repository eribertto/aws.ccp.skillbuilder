In Module 3, you learned about the following concepts:

AWS Regions and Availability Zones
Edge locations and Amazon CloudFront
The AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, and SDKs
AWS Elastic Beanstalk
AWS CloudFormation

Awesome stuff, I mean, we covered a lot of ground in here. And I don't mean that just because we talked about AWS global infrastructure. 

But seriously, we covered how logical clusters of data centers make up Availability Zones, Availability Zones in turn make up Regions, and those are spread globally. You then choose what Regions and Availability Zones you want to operate out of and as a best practice, you should always deploy infrastructure across at least two Availability Zones. And some AWS services like Elastic Load Balancing, Amazon SQS, and Amazon SNS already do this for you. 

We also talked about Edge locations and how you can deploy content there to speed up delivery to your customers. We even touched upon edge devices like AWS Outposts which allow you to run AWS infrastructure right in your own data center. 

Another thing we discussed was how to provision AWS resources through various options, such as the AWS Management Console, the SDK, CLI, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, and AWS CloudFormation, where you learned how you can set up your infrastructure as code. 

I hope you learned how globally available AWS is and how easy it is to get started with provisioning resources.
