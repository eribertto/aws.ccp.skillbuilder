Networking used to be the exclusive domain of topological geniuses. With AWS, networking is now simplified and abstracted to answer the simple question of who should be allowed to communicate with each other. As long as you can answer that question, then you can set up your network on AWS. 

We covered the basics of VPC, the virtual private cloud, the way that you isolate your workload in AWS, the fundamentals of network security, including gateways, network ACLs, and security groups, all methods that allow your security engineers to craft a network that allows healthy traffic access while dropping subversive attacks before they reach your instance, ways to connect to AWS through VPN and even Direct Connect, secure pipelines that are either encrypted over the general internet or exclusive fiber used by you and you alone. 

We also talked about the global networks that AWS provides using our Edge locations, how you can use Route 53 for DNS, and how to use CloudFront to cache content closer to your actual consumers. 

So while this only scratches the surface of the many things you can do with AWS networking, we hope that it gives you an understanding of the key moving pieces you need to get your business started.
