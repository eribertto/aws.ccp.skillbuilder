Over the last few videos, you started to learn about migration to AWS, as well as some interesting and innovative services you can use to either aid in your migration or to step your game up with AWS. 

You learned about the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework. The Cloud Adoption Framework gives you guidance on who to loop into a cloud migration, what their roles are, and the sorts of things that they should be focused on. There's the Business, People, and Governance Perspectives for nontechnical planning, and the Platform, Security, and Operations Perspectives for technical planning. 

We also talked about the six R's of migration. The R's represent different strategies on moving solutions to the cloud. They are Rehost, Replatform, Repurchase, Refactor, Retire, and Retain. 

There was also the question of how to move massive amounts of data into AWS without going over the network. This is where you learned about AWS Snowball and AWS Snowmobile, which allow you to fill in a physical device with your data and have it shipped back to AWS who then uploads it for you. This is useful to sidestep any potential throughput issues, and it is also more secure than using high-speed internet.
