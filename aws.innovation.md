There's so much more that can be done on AWS that we have time to talk about here. For example, when it comes to migrating onto AWS, we didn't even cover running VMware on AWS. The same VMware based infrastructure that you use on prem can in many cases, just be lifted up and dropped onto AWS via VMware Cloud on AWS. And this is just one of many concepts that make AWS a place where builders go to create and innovate at the pace of their ideas. 

When it comes to machine learning and artificial intelligence, AWS has the broadest and deepest set of machine learning and AI services for your business. You can choose from pre-trained AI services for computer vision, language recommendations, and forecasting. Amazon SageMaker: Quickly build, train, and deploy machine learning models at scale. 

Or build custom models with support for all the popular open-source frameworks. Our capabilities are built on the most comprehensive cloud platform, optimized for machine learning with high performance compute and no compromises on security and analytics. Tools like Amazon SageMaker and Amazon Augmented AI, or Amazon A2I, provide a machine learning platform that any business can build upon without needing PhD level expertise in-house. Or perhaps, ready-to-go AI solutions like Amazon Lex, the heart of Alexa.
[Alexa] Hello . What can I help you with?
Helps you build interactive chat bots.

Or what about Amazon Textract. Extracting text and data from documents to make them more usable for your enterprise instead of them just being locked away in a repository. 

Do you wanna put machine learning literally into the hands of your developers? Why not try AWS DeepRacer? A chance for your developers to experiment with reinforcement learning. One of the newest branches of machine learning algorithms, all while having fun in a racing environment. 

AWS offers brand new technologies in things like Internet of Things. Enabling connected devices to communicate all around the world. 

Speaking of communication around the world, have you ever wanted to have your own satellite? Too expensive to launch your own? Why not just use AWS Ground Station and only pay for the satellite time you actually need? 

I could go on for days talking about all these new technologies. Like literally for days. AWS Training and Certification offers training classes on many of these technologies already, and every month, AWS seems to release something even better for us to talk about.
