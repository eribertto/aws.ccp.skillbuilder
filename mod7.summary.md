Understanding what is happening in your environment is key to maintaining efficient, secure, and compliant applications. 

We discussed how CloudWatch can provide near real-time understanding of how your system is behaving, including being alerted to conditions that require your attention. CloudWatch also gives you the ability to look at those metrics over time as you tune your system for maximum performance. 

We discussed how CloudTrail can help you know exactly who did what, when, and from where. It answers all of your AWS auditing questions, except why they did it. 

And finally, we looked at Trusted Advisor that compiles a quick dashboard of over 40 common concerns around cost, performance, security, and resilience in an actionable dashboard. 

There are, of course, many additional monitoring and analytical tools available for your use, but this will help you get a good feeling for some of the variety AWS offers your business.
